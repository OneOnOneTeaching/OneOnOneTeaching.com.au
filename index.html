                            I really like your videos! I am an ESL teacher in Chile and these are very helpful in my class! Because I expose them to authentic English plus the grammar we will use! I'm really looking forward for more videos!

                            <!-- <p>Diane is an enthusiastic person, a strong stimulus for students, pragmatic and result-oriented teacher. She is extremely well organized and tailored her teaching in accordance with her students needs. Instructional time is not only devoted to fun, you will see a real improvement of your English proficiency. She is very professional and is always willing to help her students during the class, but also when they are back to their own countries. In a nutshell, she is the best teacher and an adorable person.
                            Melike</p> -->
                            <!-- <p>I would like to express my gratefulness and thankfulness to Teacher Diane for the lessons she has given to me since June 2013.
                            The progress that I made in English and the more confidence I feel practicing English are a reflection of my lessons with Ms. Diane in the last few months.
                            She designs her lessons in a way that matches the different needs of her students. She is able to evaluate your progress and point out the part where the students should work hard to improve.
                            Based on previous experiences on Skype with many other teachers I admit that I have really benefited in English with Ms. Diane more than I had thought before I joined her lessons.

                            <!-- <p>I’m a teacher myself, and that’s why finding an English teacher for myself was a really tough task. I wanted to work with a native, but, unfortunately, most natives think that it’s enough to be born in England or the US to be able to teach English as a second language.
                            So for the last 3 years I have been studying with about 5 different tutors, but I had no progress at all. Either tasks were to easy for me or the classes were organised so that I was listening to the tutor to speak most of the time, keeping silent myself.
                            And then I came across the site teacherdiane.com and met Diane and the things changed. I was looking forward to our next class, as I knew we would discuss some interesting subject or watch an exciting video. I learned a lot about the culture of the US, found out new things about Americans and now I had a different view on the country. I think that the secret of why Diane is the best teacher is that she is absolutely fond of what she is doing and really wants to help her students to speak English.

                            <!-- <p>I'm a graduate English student from Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. I've been having lessons with Diane for over 1 year. Diane is the number 1 and best teacher I've ever spoken to, keeping in mind that I'd spoken to more than 25 English online tutors over Skype, but no one is as excellent as her.
                            She's not only a teacher, but a super qualified native English speaker, nice, friendly, easy to talk to, thorough, enthusiastic, open-minded...etc.
                            She uses AMAZING techniques to get you excited and encouraged to talk and express your opinion.
                            She helped me a lot and I made big progress. I'm happy to be one of her students and I'm super thankful and grateful to her.

                            <!-- <p>Thank you teacher. I can say that without your work, right now I couldn’t speak anything of English, and look at me now, I’m da shit speaking English. Just kidding, just wanted to be goofy. Being honest, I appreciate so much your patience everyday with us, making all the time our classes so entertaining and interesting, trying to explain us with different ways when we didn’t understand some word, sentence or exercise. Thank you for your effort every day. I’m sure that no one could teach us English better than you. I felt in your classes like a teenager, and I’m 27 years old (I know I’m getting old). Thank you for this experience that I could never forget.

                            <p>Well, I just want to say that you are an excellent tutor, that all my progress in English was because of you, and thanks for all the help you gave me. I wish the best for you.

                            <!-- <p>Hey, Diane! I really enjoyed your class and your group was nice! Do you have NY's english accent, or Chicago-NY-Bostonian? If it's NY's, I think NY's accent is my new favorite english accent! In the past I've worked with some native english speakers colleagues, from different countries, whose accents sounded cool but I couldn't understand them at all! Yours was clearer to me!

                            <!-- <p>I’m a very lucky girl to be able to meet such an excellent teacher like you. I have gotten lots of things from you, because you teach passionately and make an effort to give us confidence. In Korea, when I studied English and took a lesson from some teacher, I didn’t feel interest in English. However, since I was taught by you, I have had much interest in English and gained confidence a lot. So, you’re my best English teacher ever.
